# Playground with Zio, Circe, and Doobie

This is my Scala playground.

To learn how to use Zio with Circe and Doobie, I wrote this program, which does:
1. Parse a JSON file containing Pokemon data;
2. Write the data into a SQLite database; and
3. Select Pikachu entry and print it out.

`pokedex.json` in resources directory is taken from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json).
